    "Stock value calculator:  100 shares of STOR capital stock was bought for $28.00 a piece and grows at 7% an year (average). It has a dividend yield of 3.4% and keeps increasing this yield by 50% each year. Write a python program which calculates (a) net worth of the stock after any given number of years (say, values like 3 years, 7 years, etc…) without dividend reinvestment, and (b) with dividend reinvestment. For explanations of dividend yield, go here : https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendyield.asp"
